# IDS 706 Week 4 Mini Project - Github Actions Matrix Build for Multiple Python Versions

## 🏗️ Requirements
- Set up a Gitlab Actions workflow
- Test across at least 3 different Python versions

## 🖨️ Output
Here, I have used 5 different Python version to test across, namely 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3,10, 3.11.
The main.py file contains a simple function which returns the multiplication of the two numbers inputted into it
